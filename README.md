# BioNano
This is a repository created to more easily share and change code/scripts associated with data processing in a lab project in the course TFY4335 Nano Life Science
The code is shared on GitHub mainly for ease of access for project partners, class mates and future students taking this course. Much of the data parsing is specific to the .XML and .tif data acquired from external data processing (mainly TrackMate for ImageJ) and microscopy images.
